1.3.0
- Decks are tiles again
- Deal to Players (new icon on tile) and Give to Players (right click card in hand)
- Cards can be "Marked" (right click the card) to highlight them a configurable color (default red) in hand
- Reveal Card (right click card) shows the card to all players
- Resetting a deck deletes all cards in play, including in players hands
- Fixed the CSS issue of the hotbar streching over to the side bar (thanks Zeel)
- Players can drop cards onto the table. They can't manipulate them, but they can drop them on the board.

1.2.1
- Added the ability to pick a card back when importing a deck by images

1.2.0
- Changed the Deck Import button to allow for importing decks from a folder of images, appending a card to an existing deck, and for converting a deck into a rolltable
- Changed the Deck to be a Token instead of a Tile so you can better configure permissions for players to interact with decks

1.1.0
- IDK did some stuff. Wasn't keeping changelogs back then.
