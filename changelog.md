1.2.0
- Changed the Deck Import button to allow for importing decks from a folder of images, appending a card to an existing deck, and for converting a deck into a rolltable
- Changed the Deck to be a Token instead of a Tile so you can better configure permissions for players to interact with decks

1.1.0
- IDK did some stuff. Wasn't keeping changelogs back then.
